# Arbitrary-Precision-Integers

Arbitrary-precision integers are a numeric representation that dynamically resizes as needed to
represent integers of any size. This avoid the overflow that can occur with fixed-width numeric
types, and the loss of precision that can occur when using floating-point types to store large
integers.
